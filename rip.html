							<h2> STEP 1</h2><br> <h3> Rip inspiration from the creativity and brilliance of those around and before you. Explore what inspires you. Learn from other people, other cultures, and other perspectives. Open your mind. </h3>

							<p>	“Walt Disney creativity”—a form of expression and genius that builds upon the culture around us and makes it something different.</p>
							<p>Thinkers of the forward-looking type whose ideas we are now considering, are beginning to realize that the most hopeful line for the development of our racial intelligence lies rather in the direction of creating a new world organ for the collection, indexing, summarizing and release of knowledge, than in any further tinkering with the highly conservative and resistant university system, local, national and traditional in texture, which already exists. These innovators, who may be dreamers today, but who hope to become  very  active  organizers  tomorrow,  project  a unified, if not a centralized, world organ to "pull the mind of the world together", which will be not  so much a rival to the universities, as a  supplementary and co-ordinating addition to their educational activities-on  a  planetary  scale.</p>                 <p>As we move into the next generation, we will advance from a disciplinary-based university structure to a distributed university structure by better integrating disciplinary excellence for the resolution of complex problems. In 2047, Virginia Tech will project its talents to the world and in tandem view the world as an extended campus.</p>
							<p>	Communities of Discovery flip the traditional instructional model where course driven learning is at the core and experiential learning is peripheral. Experiential learning wrapped around an issue, problem, or topic of the community will become the core of the educational experience, with the traditional course instruction supporting that work.</p>
					<p>An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see outside and across boundaries.</p>
							<p>He’s trying to move the campus toward a future in which researchers will work on big problems together in ways that emphasize collaboration over smaller, separate innovations, Tech President Timothy Sands said.</p>

						
							<p>Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now. That building is always and everywhere at least partially done without permission and without compensating the original creator. </p>                                                                                 <p> The things taken by anyone exercising Walt Disney creativity—are valuable, our tradition does not treat those takings as wrong. Some things remain free for the taking within a free culture, and that freedom is good.</p>
							<p> Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build upon </p>
