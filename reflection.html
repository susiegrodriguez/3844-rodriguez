							<p>The concept of “Rip, Mix, Burn” is one that I find most compelling in this unit because, to me, it ties in with the idea behind what it means to be a VT-Shaped student. While reading all of the articles on what a VT-Shaped student is meant to be, one common idea I found amongst all of them is this emphasis on the expansion of education in order to form well rounded students knowledgeable in multiple areas of study, and, most of all, open minded to ideas outside of their main discipline. To me, this shows a push toward the future for Virginia Tech. Hopefully this means that students will be more free to explore other disciplines outside of their field and gain knowledge that they wouldn’t have access to if they were limited to a strict one-track curriculum. The reason that the VT-Shaped student idea excites me is because, as I said previously, it puts forth such an emphasis of the expansion of knowledge, and this expansion of knowledge is essential for molding a future generation that is capable of learning from the people and the cultures around and before them in order to develop new and innovative ideas in all areas of life. Maybe one day, an art student studying at Virginia tech will be able to incorporate ideas she learns in Biology class into her art, or a VT engineering student will be able to be inspired in her work  by a book she read in her literature class. Overall, what excites me the most is this coming together of different perspectives. I believe that the new VT-Shaped student will be capable of this concept of “Rip, Mix Burn”.  I believe that, in concept, the VT-Shaped student will be able to rip inspiration from the world around them, mix together outside ideas with their own imagination, and from that, create something completely extraordinary, blazoning a whole trail in their field for future generations</p>
							<p> Throughout this course I have learned a lot about digital writing and the creative concepts that are behind much of what digital writing is all about. The concept of “Rip, Mix, Burn” that Lawrence Lesseg introduces is, to me, not only a connecting thread between all of the Module one readings, going back even to the H.G. Well’s “World Brain”, but is also a connecting thread between the modules themselves. This “Rip, Mix, Burn” concept, which is the basis of my Remix, is centered around the idea that human beings achieve brilliance and advance farther when they work together and are open to building on the great ideas of those around them and those that came before them. One thing that I have learned is that the whole of human knowledge is constantly moving forward as people learn from each other and make new and innovative discoveries, a trend that is reflected in society and culture as well . With this constant flow forward, digital writing is keenly important, because, as was pointed out on the first day of this class, without written content, the internet is just a bunch of empty boxes. </p>
							<p> After completing this course I find myself, in a way, back where I began. My exploration of digital writing all started with  Lawrence Lessegs concept of “Rip, Mix, Burn”,  and now that I am finishing up the final module, I feel that my understanding of his concept in terms of digital media has only deepened. Each module brought a deeper understanding of what “Rip, Mix, Burn” means and its significance in the VT-Shaped student model, as well as in the realm of digital writing as whole.  Digital writing is key in spreading knowledge across the internet, and in this day and age, where billions of people are exposed to some sort of digital writing every day, it transforms from merely a useful skill to have into a very powerful tool, capable of influencing  people across the globe. Throughout this entire semester, my appreciation for digital writing has increased immensely and continues to grow.  I have realized that digital writing provides not just a personal outlet for one’s creativity, but also a powerful means of spreading that creativity to people on a large, even global scale. When looking to the future I can almost guarantee that the digital writing skills I have learned in this class will appear again in future classes and, more importantly, in future career opportunities. As you read through the rest of these sections exploring, in depth, the concepts of “Rip, Mix, Burn” and the VT-Shaped student, I encourage you to try and discover your own creative spark and to draw on that spark for inspiration in imagining a brighter and more innovative future. </p>
